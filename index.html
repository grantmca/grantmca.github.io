<h2>About</h2>
<p>
Hey there! I'm Grant McAllister, a Software Engineer at EAB. I've always been into technology, and as a lifelong learner, I'm constantly exploring new ideas and concepts in the tech world.

I've got a Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering and a Master of Science in Management Information Systems under my belt. These experiences have given me a solid foundation in software development, web development, and database management. But I believe that learning doesn't stop with a degree—it's an ongoing process that continues throughout your career.

At EAB, I work as a full-stack developer, mainly focusing on a Rails application. But I also get to explore and work with a bunch of other technologies. It's an exciting environment that allows me to expand my skills and tackle new challenges every day.

I believe that the best way to really learn something is by teaching others. That's why I wanted to create this blog—to share my knowledge, experiences, and insights with fellow developers and enthusiasts.

I'll be sharing my thoughts on various technical topics, from software engineering concepts to specific technologies and frameworks. My goal is to present the information in a clear, concise, and approachable way that can teach others and hopefully teach me something as well.

<h2>Contact</h2>

I'm always eager to connect with fellow developers and learn from others. If you have any questions, comments, or ideas you'd like to share, feel free to reach out to me at <a href="mailto:grantmca2221@gmail.com">grantmca2221@gmail.com</a>. I'd love to discuss them with you!
